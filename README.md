# [Investigation on mold breakout prediction methods based on image recognition via convolutional neural network]

## Overview
This project develops a mold breakout prediction model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It employs two CNN architectures—VGG16 with transfer learning and a fine-grained MixDCNN—to distinguish true sticking regions from false ones in thermographic images. The primary goal is to identify sticking breakout samples from varied temperature patterns while filtering out normal condition samples. Ultimately, this offers a novel data-driven approach to anomaly detection in the continuous casting process.
